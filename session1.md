## Session 1

Every human being is, in one way or another, unique.
Everyone's personality is **_determined_** by a **_combination_** of genetic and environmental **_factors_**.

   - We were **bound and determined** [=very determined] to finish the project on time
2. **factors**
3. **examine**
4. **interact**
5. **heredity** /həˈrɛdəti/
